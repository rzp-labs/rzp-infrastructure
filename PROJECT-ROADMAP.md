# RZP Infrastructure Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview

RZP Infrastructure is a GitOps-managed homelab infrastructure repository that powers 100+ services using Infrastructure
as Code (IaC) principles with Pulumi and Python. This roadmap outlines the implementation phases for establishing a
type-safe, testable infrastructure codebase.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-4) - Week 1

**Objective**: Establish Pulumi project foundation and core framework

### Critical Path Tasks:

- **Task 1**: Initialize Pulumi Python project structure
- **Task 2**: Configure Pulumi for YAML manifest generation → `/kubernetes`
- **Task 3**: Create Pydantic models for type-safe configuration
- **Task 4**: Implement base ComponentResource framework

### Parallel Work:

- **Task 14**: Set up pytest infrastructure for unit testing

**Deliverables**: Working Pulumi project with type-safe models and base framework

## Phase 2: Core Components (Tasks 5-10) - Week 2

**Objective**: Build reusable component library with automatic standards enforcement

### Critical Path Tasks:

- **Task 5**: Build BaseService component with monitoring integration
- **Task 6**: Add backup capabilities to BaseService
- **Task 7**: Implement network policies in BaseService
- **Task 10**: Build manifest post-processing pipeline

### Parallel Work:

- **Task 8**: Create StatefulService specialized component
- **Task 9**: Implement CronJob specialized component
- **Task 13**: Create secret management abstraction

**Deliverables**: Complete component library with monitoring, backups, and network policies

## Phase 3: Provider Integration & Testing (Tasks 11-17) - Week 3

**Objective**: Integrate external providers and establish comprehensive testing

### Provider Integration:

- **Task 11**: Configure Proxmox provider integration
- **Task 12**: Implement Cloudflare provider for DNS

### Testing Infrastructure:

- **Task 15**: Write unit tests for ComponentResource framework
- **Task 16**: Add integration tests for provider interactions
- **Task 17**: Create manifest validation test suite

### Support Systems:

- **Task 18**: Implement resource naming and labeling system
- **Task 19**: Build cross-service dependency management

**Deliverables**: Fully tested framework with provider integrations

## Phase 4: Platform Services (Tasks 20-23) - Week 4

**Objective**: Define core platform services and observability stack

### Critical Tasks:

- **Task 20**: Create platform service definitions (monitoring, backup, secrets)
- **Task 21**: Implement multi-environment support
- **Task 23**: Add observability stack components

### Enhancement:

- **Task 22**: Create service template library

**Deliverables**: Platform services ready for deployment with full observability

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish (Tasks 24-28) - Week 5

**Objective**: Add advanced deployment features and complete implementation

### Advanced Features:

- **Task 24**: Build deployment strategy components (canary, blue-green)
- **Task 25**: Implement resource optimization helpers

### Documentation & CI/CD:

- **Task 26**: Create comprehensive documentation
- **Task 27**: Build CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure

### Validation:

- **Task 28**: Generate initial service manifests for 10-15 services

**Deliverables**: Production-ready infrastructure with CI/CD and documentation

## Critical Path Analysis

The critical path through the project:

```
1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 20 → 28
```

This represents the minimum set of tasks that must be completed sequentially to achieve a working system.

```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Pulumi to YAML transformation complexity**: Start with simple resources (Task 2)
2. **Provider API limitations**: Abstract interfaces early (Tasks 11-12)
3. **Testing complexity**: Establish patterns early (Task 14)
4. **Standards enforcement**: Strong typing from start (Task 3)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All 28 tasks completed
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage achieved
- ✅ 10-15 services successfully deployed
- ✅ Zero manual manifest editing required
- ✅ All services have monitoring, backups, network policies by default

## Estimated Timeline

- **Total Duration**: 4-5 weeks
- **Daily Velocity**: 1-2 tasks per day
- **Buffer Time**: 1 week for unexpected issues

## Next Steps

1. Review generated tasks in `/tasks` directory
2. Start with Task #1: Initialize Pulumi Python project
3. Run: `task-master next` to begin implementation
