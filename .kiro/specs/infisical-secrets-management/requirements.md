# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Infisical as a secrets management solution within our Kubernetes infrastructure. Infisical is an open-source secrets management platform that provides secure storage, access control, and audit capabilities for application secrets. The implementation will create a Pulumi component that deploys Infisical to our Kubernetes cluster, integrates with our existing infrastructure components, and provides a foundation for centralized secrets management across all applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to deploy Infisical to our Kubernetes cluster, so that we have a centralized secrets management solution for all applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Infisical component is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated namespace for Infisical
2. WHEN the component is instantiated THEN the system SHALL deploy Infisical using Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests
3. WHEN Infisical is deployed THEN the system SHALL configure persistent storage for secrets data
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify Infisical pods are running and healthy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Infisical to be accessible through our ingress controller, so that developers can access the web interface securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Infisical is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an ingress resource for web access
2. WHEN the ingress is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with our existing Traefik ingress controller
3. WHEN TLS is required THEN the system SHALL configure SSL certificates through cert-manager
4. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Infisical to integrate with our existing infrastructure components, so that it follows our deployment patterns and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Infisical is deployed THEN the system SHALL depend on the cert-manager component for TLS certificates
2. WHEN Infisical requires storage THEN the system SHALL integrate with Longhorn for persistent volumes
3. WHEN the component is created THEN the system SHALL follow our existing component architecture patterns
4. WHEN dependencies are not met THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Infisical with initial setup parameters, so that it's ready for use after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Infisical is deployed THEN the system SHALL configure database connection settings
2. WHEN initial setup is required THEN the system SHALL create necessary ConfigMaps and Secrets
3. WHEN authentication is configured THEN the system SHALL retrieve initial admin credentials from Pulumi config secrets
4. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options through the component interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the Infisical component to be testable and maintainable, so that it integrates with our existing testing and deployment workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate component configuration and resource creation
3. WHEN the component is deployed THEN the system SHALL include health checks and readiness probes
4. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL verify Infisical API accessibility and functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want Infisical to be deployed with proper security configurations, so that secrets are protected according to security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Infisical is deployed THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate RBAC permissions
2. WHEN network policies are enabled THEN the system SHALL restrict network access to necessary communications only
3. WHEN secrets are stored THEN the system SHALL use encryption at rest and in transit
4. WHEN audit logging is required THEN the system SHALL configure audit trails for secret access and modifications
